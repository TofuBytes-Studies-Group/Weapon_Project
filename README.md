## Machine Learning and AI exam projects

#### This is part 1 of the ML and AI exam.

In this repository is our Jupyter notebook, and our machine learned models.
We are using this Jupyter notebook to clean the dataset and train the models to be able to make a price prediction for newly created weapons.
